# rock-paper-scissors

    This is my rock-paper-scissors project assigned in the fundamental course by The Odin Project. I've used different words instead of rock-paper-scissors (pink slippers, coffee mug, joana). My word choice is inspired by the Sneaky Slambert lore. Currently the game only works from the console.
